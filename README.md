# Customer Churn Prediction

This is a machine learning project created using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates a complete churn prediction pipeline. It includes:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering.
- Model training with classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
- Visualizations for data understanding and model performance.

## Files Included

- `Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and modeling workflow.
- `Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset containing customer information and churn labels.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
